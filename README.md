# ComputerAudio_CassettePlayer

This program was written in Processing. I used the basic implementation of a cassette tape. The program has the ability to play, stop, fast-forward, rewind, and reset a sound.

Each function performs as they are labeled. Play starts a sound from the beginning and then resumes from where it is altered (ie. when stopped, fast-forwarded, or rewinded). Stop pauses the sound, fast-forward, rewind do as labeled. Reset starts the music from the beginning.

I chose a "gameboy" theme for the sound bytes in this project. The main music is a game background sound, while the filters for each function (play, stop, rewind, etc.) each have a "game sound", such as the mario coin, slide, jump, and power up. There are no special features.
